As Thanksgiving and the Winter Holidays approach, Americans flock to transportation methods to get across their states and across the country. According to a <a href="https://newsroom.aaa.com/2025/11/aaa-thanksgiving-travel-forecast-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a> from the American Automotive Association (AAA), 81.8 million Americans are expected to take to the roads, rails and skies over this Thanksgiving holiday, which would be a new record high. If the projection is true, it breaks the previous record of 80.2 million travelers seen just a year ago in 2024. 73.28 million of 81.8 million projected are likely to use their vehicles as their mode of transport, while over 6 million people will take to the skies through one of the nation's nearly 20,000 airport facilities. The remaining 2.5 million people will use other modes of transport, rail being one of them.

Amtrak, the national passenger railroad agency of the United States, has never been the first choice of travelers outside the Northeast Corridor. A combination of the vast distances people travel over Thanksgiving, coupled with America's prioritization of automobiles over trains will push most people to use air and road modes to get around. But within the last few years, Amtrak has been seeing surges of interest around holiday travel, and Thanksgiving is by all means part of that group. Let's talk about this year's Thanksgiving rush on Amtrak, and what it spells for the future of rail service in America - particularly over holidays.

## Amtrak's Growing Position in Holiday Travel

Amtrak operates routes across the nation, but the vast majority of its ridership, revenue and convenience come in urban corridors, most notably the Northeast Corridor, which links Boston to Washington via Providence, New Haven, New York City, Philadelphia and Baltimore. *Northeast Regional* and its faster, more premium sister service *Acela* often beat out driving and sometimes flying times between intermediate points on the NEC, making it a viable candidate for people looking to travel. Outside of the Northeast, Amtrak Midwest routes in and around Chicago tend to do well, backed by a consistent state-funded investment to upgrade track speeds to 110mph and invest in new rolling stock. The last bright spot is all the way out west, both in the Pacific Northwest with Amtrak Cascades, and in California with Amtrak California services in the Bay Area, Central Valley, and SoCal areas.

Typically, the majority of its riders on intercity and regional services, especially on the NEC, are business travelers or commuters - which makes surging holiday travel demand on Amtrak that much more important. In 2024, <a href="https://media.amtrak.com/2025/11/thanksgiving-travel-2025-infographic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amtrak cited</a> that 1.2 million passengers chose to travel by rail over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, up 4.2% from the previous year. The Sunday after Thanksgiving, more than 144,000 passengers rode Amtrak in a single day, driven primarily by people returning home and by college students returning to their universities. 81% of these passengers traveled less than 250 miles on Amtrak services, while roughly 16% of passengers traveled anywhere from 250 miles or greater. I included a graphic from Amtrak's Media Center looking back on Thanksgiving 2024 statistics below!

This year, though, the prelude building up to Thanksgiving looked slightly different. A shutdown of the United States federal government, caused by a failure to pass a 2026 fiscal year budget from Congress, sent many government services and operations into frenzy - included in this were the 11,000 air traffic controllers (ATCs) certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that keep America's airspace running smoothly. A failed budget meant most government workers, including air traffic controllers went without pay, which caused severe reductions in personnel in some of the nation's busiest airspaces. To help keep airspaces safe and manageable for the reduced ATCs, the FAA mandated many airlines to reduce flights at busy airports, which caused severe delays and cancellations across the nation - see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/1otqz0y/this_massive_queue_of_planes_at_newark_airport/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video</a> of dozens of planes lined up, waiting to depart at Newark Liberty International Airport on November 10th.

With Thanksgiving being a natural time of travel, many were worried that their seemingly-surefire travel plans would be sent into frenzy. To combat this, many turned to the other option that ensured they wouldn't have to drive - Amtrak. Ticket prices on Amtrak's website surged as people flocked to Amtrak services as a replacement for air travel - Amtrak's president sent out multiple notices encouraging riders to book trains early, as Amtrak was seeing record numbers of interest from passengers. The agency is projecting a new record-high ridership number over Thanksgiving weekend, breaking that 1.2 million number from last year - according to booking data, Amtrak is projecting a double-digit growth in riders from last year to this year. Additional cars are also being added to *Northeast Regional* services over November 25-30th, in an attempt to maximize ridership over America's busiest rail corridor.

## A Mildly Dim Present, but a REALLY Bright Future?

The surging interest in American rail service is a big positive for Amtrak, but it seems to have come in probably one of Amtrak's more negative years. In March, the company lost over 104 Horizon railcars from service due to corrosion issues, railcars that formed the backbone of the intercity services for Amtrak Midwest and Amtrak Cascades. A substantial loss of that magnitude meant Amtrak had to commit to a complete reshuffling of their fleet. To absolutely no one's surprise, the ever-reliable Amfleet cars, built by Budd Transportation of Philadelphia almost 50 years ago, were spread thin across the country to resemble some kind of service restoration on every line - even if it meant that trains were reduced to just two or three passenger coaches. Delays in the approval of the *NextGen Acela* trainsets forced the legacy *Acela Express* sets to stay in service for 5 years beyond their expected lifetime, which was seen through rapidly-declining reliability and consistent delays and cancelations caused by mechanical fleet issues. And infrastructure projects, sent underway largely by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed by President Joe Biden, are still in the midst of completion, which means Amtrak continues to rely on its 100+ year old infrastructure, which is plagued by reliability and structural issues and low speed restrictions.

And yet, despite the seemingly endless negative news about Amtrak's fleet and infrastructure problems, if there was ever a year where America would finally turn back to rail, this was probably a good one to choose. In August, Amtrak unveiled, for the first time in passenger service, their new NextGen Acela trainsets, destined to run high-speed Acela services on the Northeast Corridor. Slowly but surely, more and more daily Acela trips have been fitted with the new NextGen trainsets, with Amtrak aiming for a final date of 2027 for the phasing-in of their new rolling stock. Yes, they've had door problems. Yes, the seats aren't quite as comfy as the old ones. But it's a huge step up for people who see the trains from the outside. Visual perception of trains is an important thing for a lot of people, especially those who might not travel by train all the time - it could one of several turning factors that takes them to the rails. The sleek red, white, and blue color scheme, the huge windows, the ever-promoted "no middle seat" as compared to planes, and the general look and feel of these new trains propels you into a different generation of rail travel, especially when compared to the old ones. It's one of the first times that we've seen a non-steel exterior on a train, and I think it's a particularly important visual aspect to have, especially when trying to cater to people who do not look at train travel the way the rest of the world does.

Outside of the Acela fleet, let's not forget about Amtrak's Airo trainsets. Manufactured entirely by Siemens Mobility in Sacramento, California, Amtrak is looking to bring in upwards of 80 Airo trainsets for use across its Northeast services, as well as on the Cascades in the Pacific Northwest. Bigger windows, more airy interiors, brighter lights, (hopefully) semi-comfortable chairs and better amenities are just a few of the big positives on the way with the Airos. The first trainset, configured to run on the Amtrak Cascades service in Washington and Oregon, has completed testing in Colorado, and has moved to the Northeast Corridor for further testing in the Philadelphia area. Amtrak hopes to get the first trainset operational in the PNW by next year, before the first Northeast Corridor trainsets go into revenue service in 2027. By the end, the Airos will somewhat functionally replace the Amfleets - but let's be honest, these Amfleet cars are going to outlive you, me, and these Airos. On a real note, it might be a good idea, temporarily, for Amtrak to use the extra Amfleets on routes like the Mardi Gras Service, which would allow for increased capacity on a clearly higher-than-expected demand route.

## The Demand Is Here. It's Amtrak's Turn to Match It.
Beyond just Thanksgiving, Amtrak's fiscal year 2025 results proved that Americans are getting warmer and warmer towards passenger rail. A record 34.5 million people took to the rails in FY2025, likely limited only by Amtrak's suppressing fleet issues. With the NextGen Acelas phasing in, Airos on their way to operational duties, and hundreds of huge infrastructure projects well underway across the country, America's getting back into railroading. The demand is there. The question is - will Amtrak meet the demand?

(I think so).
